### Overall Performance Interpretation:

- **Accuracy**: The CNN outperforms the ANN, achieving a peak validation accuracy of 0.9942 by epoch 22, compared to the ANN's 0.9780 by epoch 15, a ~1.6% improvement, reflecting superior generalization.
- **Convergence**: The CNN reaches a validation accuracy of 0.9810 by epoch 2 and peaks at 0.9942, with faster convergence than the ANN, which plateaus at 0.9780, aided by batch normalization and a learning rate scheduler.
- **Misclassifications**: Both models show similar errors (e.g., class 4 → 9 at 12), but the CNN reduces errors like class 5 → 6 (9 vs. 11) and increases correct predictions (e.g., 977 vs. 969 for class 0), leveraging its convolutional layers.
- **Optimization Impact**: The CNN's enhancements (e.g., dropout, data augmentation, extended epochs to 25) result in better consistency and lower validation loss (0.0213 vs. 0.0739), demonstrating the effectiveness of its optimized design over the ANN.
